# COVID_TRACKER
Hi , Welcome to "COVID_TRACKER"!







This is a python-coded bot. 

Currently i have 2 bots under the **@project_tweepy** twitter handle and this is one of them.

So ,Let's talk about this **bot** now .

**COVID_TRACKER** 

This bot is pretty self explanatory as the title says this bot gives you the latest *covid* statistics when you mention it.




To run this bot you can just copy and paste the code into any python ide of your choice and run it (of course you will need the twitter's api **Tweepy** and a few other things to make it work) . I would recommend checking out a youtube tutorial first and then coming back here to check both of these bots out. 


Check out my other bot [**AUTO_TWEEP**](https://github.com/DevashishRanjanGLA/AUTO_TWEEP) here.
