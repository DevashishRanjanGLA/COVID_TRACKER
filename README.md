# COVID_TRACKER
Hi , Welcome to "COVID_TRACKER"!







This is a python-coded bot. 

Currently i have 2 bots under the **@project_tweepy** twitter handle and this is one of them.

So ,Let's talk about this **bot** now .

**COVID_TRACKER** 

This bot is pretty self explanatory as the title says this bot gives you the latest *covid* statistics when you mention it.
This bot uses twitter's api **tweepy** , python web scraping libraires & the site that i am using for data scraping is **https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/**.




To run this bot you can just copy and paste the code into any python ide of your choice and run it (of course you will need the twitter's api **Tweepy** and a few other things to make it work) . I would recommend checking out a youtube tutorial first and then coming back here to check both of these bots out. 


Check out my other bot [**AUTO_TWEEP**](https://github.com/DevashishRanjanGLA/AUTO_TWEEP) here.
